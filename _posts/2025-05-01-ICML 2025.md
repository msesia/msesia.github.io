My collaborators and I had two papers accepted to the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) this year, one of which was selected as a spotlight (top 2.6% of submissions).

The **spotlight paper**, with Vladimir Svetnik, presents a doubly robust conformal method for survival analysis with right-censored data, offering reliable inferences even when survival models are misspecified.
