Iâ€™m an assistant professor in the [Department of Data Sciences and Operations](https://www.marshall.usc.edu/departments/data-sciences-and-operations), at the [University of Southern California, Marshall School of Business](https://www.marshall.usc.edu/).

My research focuses on distribution-free inference and uncertainty-aware machine learning. 
Within these areas, I am particularly interested in developing methods that combine the reliability of provable finite-sample statistical guarantees with the power of complex data-driven algorithms.


I am interested in building new collaborations, and I have research projects available for highly motivated PhD students.
If you are a PhD student already admitted to USC, please feel free to email me about possible research opportunities.
If you are not yet a USC student, but you are interested in our PhD program, please visit the [PhD program information page](https://www.marshall.usc.edu/programs/phd-program/departments/data-sciences-and-operations). 
Applications to the PhD program are handled by the department through the official procedure described in the above page.
