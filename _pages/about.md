Iâ€™m an assistant professor in the [Department of Data Sciences and Operations](https://www.marshall.usc.edu/departments/data-sciences-and-operations), at the [University of Southern California, Marshall School of Business](https://www.marshall.usc.edu/).

My research focuses on distribution-free inference and uncertainty-aware machine learning. 
Within these areas, I am particularly interested in developing methods that combine the reliability of provable finite-sample statistical guarantees with the power of complex data-driven algorithms.

I am interested in building new collaborations, and I have research projects available for highly motivated graduate students from USC.
Do not hesitate to contact me if you would like to talk about these opportunities, or more generally discuss research we may both find interesting.
