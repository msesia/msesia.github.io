Iâ€™m an assistant professor in the [Department of Data Sciences and Operations](https://www.marshall.usc.edu/departments/data-sciences-and-operations), at the [University of Southern California, Marshall School of Business](https://www.marshall.usc.edu/).

My research is concerned with developing practical statistical methods that combine the power of machine learning algorithms with the reliability of provable model-free statistical guarantees.
While pursuing this goal, I enjoy dividing my time between theoretical, methodological, computational, and applied work. 

I am interested in building new collaborations, and I have several possible research projects available for highly motivated USC graduate students.
Do not hesitate to contact me if you would like to talk about these opportunities, or more generally discuss research we may both find interesting.
