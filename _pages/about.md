Iâ€™m an assistant professor in the [Department of Data Sciences and Operations](https://www.marshall.usc.edu/departments/data-sciences-and-operations), at the [University of Southern California, Marshall School of Business](https://www.marshall.usc.edu/).

My research is concerned with developing practical statistical methods that combine the power of machine learning algorithms with the reliability of provable model-free statistical guarantees.
While pursuing this goal, I enjoy dividing my time between theoretical, methodological, computational, and applied work. 

I am very interested in building new collaborations, as well as in advising USC students.
If you would like to chat about this, or more generally talk about research we may both find interesting, do not hesitate to contact me.
