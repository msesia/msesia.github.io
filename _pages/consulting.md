Interested in working together?
I’m happy to offer a free initial consultation to discuss your project and explore how I may be able to help. Feel free to reach out at *sesia@pvalueconsulting.llc* for more information.

Over the past several years, I’ve provided statistical consulting across academia, industry, and publishing. My experience spans a range of real-world applications—from analyzing government crime data for a published nonfiction book, to developing modern, research-grade inference tools for a global pharmaceutical company.

I began consulting as a PhD student at Stanford, where I participated in (and later led) the Statistics Department’s consulting workshop. Since then, I’ve collaborated on numerous applied biomedical research projects that have led to peer-reviewed publications. In 2020, I received Stanford’s Jerome H. Friedman Applied Statistics Dissertation Award, which recognizes the best PhD thesis in applied statistics each year.

My consulting work is grounded in the same principles that guide my research: practical, reliable statistical analysis using cutting-edge methods tailored to each problem’s needs.
