Selected projects:

- [*ARC*](https://github.com/msesia/arc): Python package for adaptive and reliable classification.
- [*KnockoffZoom*](https://msesia.github.io/knockoffzoom/): Flexible tool for the multi-resolution localization of causal variants across the genome.
- [*DeepKnockoffs*](https://github.com/msesia/DeepKnockoffs): Python package for approximate knockoffs and model-free variable selection.
- [*SNPknock*](https://msesia.github.io/snpknock/): R package for generating knockoffs of hidden Markov models and genetic data. 
- [*SNPknock for Python*](https://github.com/msesia/snpknock-python): Python package for generating knockoffs of hidden Markov models and genetic data. Note: this package is not up-to-date compared to the corresponding R package; the R package is currently recommended.
- [*Knockoffs*](https://web.stanford.edu/group/candes/knockoffs/): R and MATLAB packages for powerful and versatile controlled variable selection.
