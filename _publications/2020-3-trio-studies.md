**Abstract**

We introduce a method to rigorously draw causal inferences—inferences immune to all pos-sible  confounding—from  genetic  data  that  include  parents  and  offspring.   Causal  conclusionsare  possible  with  these  data  because  the  natural  randomness  in  meiosis  can  be  viewed  as  a high-dimensional randomized experiment.  We make this observation actionable by developinga novel conditional independence test that identifies regions of the genome containing distinct causal variants.  The proposed Digital  Twin  Testcompares an observed offspring to carefully constructed synthetic offspring from the same parents in order to determine statistical significance,  and  it  can  leverage  any  black-box  multivariate  model  and  additional  non-trio  genetic data in order to increase power.  Crucially, our inferences are based only on a well-established mathematical description of the rearrangement of genetic material during meiosis and make no assumptions about the relationship between the genotypes and phenotypes.
