**Abstract**

Liver resection remains the most effective and practical treatment for HCC patients. In patients with metastatic or newly diagnosed HCC, the presence of CTC is an independent predictive factor for recurrence-free (RFS) and overall survival (OS). HCC recurrence frequently occurs within the first year after resection, probably due to CTCs that have been shed from the primary tumor before resection.
The aim of the study is to determine if the presence of CTC prior to and during post-surgery follow-up is related to RFS and OS.
