I am a tenured Associate Professor in the [Department of Data Sciences and Operations](https://www.marshall.usc.edu/departments/data-sciences-and-operations) at the [USC Marshall School of Business](https://www.marshall.usc.edu/). I also hold a courtesy appointment in [Computer Science](https://www.cs.usc.edu/) in the [Viterbi School of Engineering](https://viterbischool.usc.edu/).

Prior to joining USC, I earned a Ph.D. in Statistics from Stanford University in 2020, where I was advised by [Emmanuel Candès](https://profiles.stanford.edu/emmanuel-candes). I am originally from Italy and completed my undergraduate and graduate studies at [Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it/en) and [Collegio Carlo Alberto](https://www.carloalberto.org/).

### Research Interests

My research lies at the intersection of statistics and machine learning, with a focus on developing practical, reliable methods for analyzing complex, high-dimensional data. I aim to create tools that are not only statistically rigorous but also effective and broadly applicable in real-world settings—where data are often imperfect, and modeling assumptions rarely hold.

A unifying theme across my work is the development of distribution-free inference techniques that enable trustworthy prediction and robust variable selection—especially in areas such as machine learning, genetics, and biomedical research.
