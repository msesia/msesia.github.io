I am an Associate Professor (with tenure) in the [Department of Data Sciences and Operations](https://www.marshall.usc.edu/departments/data-sciences-and-operations) at the [USC Marshall School of Business](https://www.marshall.usc.edu/), with a courtesy appointment in [Computer Science](https://www.cs.usc.edu/) at the [Viterbi School of Engineering](https://viterbischool.usc.edu/).

Before joining USC, I earned a Ph.D. in Statistics at Stanford University in 2020, advised by [Emmanuel Candès](https://profiles.stanford.edu/emmanuel-candes).
I am originally from Italy, where I studied at [Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it/en) and [Collegio Carlo Alberto](https://www.carloalberto.org/).

### Research Interests

I develop statistical methods for analyzing complex, high-dimensional data using modern machine learning models. I am particularly interested in *distribution-free* and *model-agnostic* approaches that can produce precise statistical inferences under defensible assumptions.
I sometimes also work as a consultant and expert collaborator in both academic and industry settings, helping to design reproducible data analyses, quantify uncertainty in complex models, and communicate results clearly to diverse audiences.

### Information for Prospective Students and Collaborators

I welcome new collaborations and have several research projects that may be of interest to highly motivated Ph.D. students. If you are a current Ph.D. student at USC and would like to work with me, feel free to reach out by email.

If you are not yet at USC but are considering applying to one of our Ph.D. programs, please visit the [DSO Ph.D. program information page](https://www.marshall.usc.edu/programs/phd-program/departments/data-sciences-and-operations) or the [CS Ph.D. program information page](https://www.cs.usc.edu/academic-programs/phd/). All applications are submitted through the departments’ standard admissions processes described on those pages.
