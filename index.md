I am an Associate Professor (with tenure) in the [Department of Data Sciences and Operations](https://www.marshall.usc.edu/departments/data-sciences-and-operations) at the [USC Marshall School of Business](https://www.marshall.usc.edu/), with a courtesy appointment in [Computer Science](https://www.cs.usc.edu/) at the [Viterbi School of Engineering](https://viterbischool.usc.edu/).

Before joining USC, I earned a Ph.D. in Statistics at Stanford University in 2020, advised by [Emmanuel Candès](https://profiles.stanford.edu/emmanuel-candes).
I am originally from Italy, where I studied at [Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it/en) and [Collegio Carlo Alberto](https://www.carloalberto.org/).

### Research Interests

I develop statistical methods for analyzing complex, high-dimensional data using modern machine learning models. I am particularly interested in *distribution-free* and *model-agnostic* approaches that can produce precise statistical inferences under defensible assumptions.
I sometimes also work as a consultant and expert collaborator in both academic and industry settings, helping to design reproducible data analyses, quantify uncertainty in complex models, and communicate results clearly to diverse audiences.
