I am a tenured Associate Professor in the [Department of Data Sciences and Operations](https://www.marshall.usc.edu/departments/data-sciences-and-operations) at the [USC Marshall School of Business](https://www.marshall.usc.edu/), with a courtesy appointment in [Computer Science](https://www.cs.usc.edu/) at the [Viterbi School of Engineering](https://viterbischool.usc.edu/).

Before joining USC, I completed my Ph.D. in Statistics at Stanford University in 2020, where I was advised by [Emmanuel Candès](https://profiles.stanford.edu/emmanuel-candes). Originally from Italy, I earned my undergraduate and master's degrees at [Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it/en) and [Collegio Carlo Alberto](https://www.carloalberto.org/).

### Research Interests

My research focuses on developing statistically rigorous and practically useful methods for analyzing complex, high-dimensional data using modern machine learning models. I am particularly interested in problems where traditional modeling assumptions are hard to justify—a situation that arises more frequently as data grow in scale and complexity, and as increasingly sophisticated AI models are applied in sensitive, high-stakes domains.

A central theme in my work is *distribution-free* and *model-agnostic* inference. These methods are designed to work alongside complex machine learning models to **identify important variables**, **ensure reproducibility**, and **quantify uncertainty**, all while relying on **defensible assumptions**.
Because they are grounded in fundamental statistical principles rather than tied to specific models or rigid distributional assumptions, these tools are highly adaptable and likely to remain relevant as AI continues to evolve. 

I also work as a **consultant** and expert collaborator in both academic and industry settings, helping to design reproducible data analyses, quantify uncertainty in complex models, and communicate results clearly to diverse audiences—especially in contexts where transparency and scientific defensibility are critical.

### Information for Prospective Students and Collaborators

I welcome new collaborations and have several research projects that may be of interest to highly motivated Ph.D. students. If you are a current Ph.D. student at USC and would like to work with me, feel free to reach out by email.

If you are not yet at USC but are considering applying to one of our Ph.D. programs, please visit the [DSO Ph.D. program information page](https://www.marshall.usc.edu/programs/phd-program/departments/data-sciences-and-operations) or the [CS Ph.D. program information page](https://www.cs.usc.edu/academic-programs/phd/). All applications are submitted through the departments’ standard admissions processes described on those pages.
